Concrete has very low tensile strength campared to its compressive strength. In a RC beam, as the applied moment exceeds the cracking moment Mcr, the maximum tensile stress in concrete exceeds the flexural tensile strength of concrete fcr, and the beam begins to crack on the tension side. The cracks are initiated in the tensile fibres of the beam, and with increasing loading, widen and propagate gradually towards the neutral axis (NA) resulting in reduction in the effective concrete section. Due to this cracking, the tensile stresses arecarried  solely by the reinforcing steel. The dirstribution strainsand stressesin a singly reinforced RC beam for uncracked phase and craked phase is shown in figures below.

<strong>Modes of failure of a concrete beam</strong><br>

A reinforced concrete beam is considered to have failed when the strain of concrete in extreme compression fibre reaches its ultimate value (ε<sub>c</sub>=ε<sub>cu</sub>), irrespective of whether the tension steel yielded or not. At this stage, the actual strainin steel ε<sub>st</sub> ,can have the following values:

  a) Equal to failure strain of steel corresponding to balanced section (ε<sub>st</sub>=ε<sub>y</sub>).

  b) More than failure strain, corresponding to under reinforced section(ε<sub>st</sub> >ε<sub>y</sub>).

  c) Less than failure strain corresponding to over reinforced section(ε<sub>st</sub> <ε<sub>y</sub>).

<i>Balanced section</i>

The strain in steel and strain in concrete reach their maximum values simultaneously. The percentage of tension steel in this beam is known as critical or limiting steel percentage (p<sub>t,lim</sub>). For this section the depth of neutral axis (NA) isx<sub>u</sub> = x<sub>u,max</sub>.  

<i>Under-reinforced section </i>

An under-reinforced beam is the one in which tension steel percentage (p<sub>t</sub>) is less than critical or limiting percentage (p<sub>t,lim</sub>). Due to this, the NA is above the balanced NA and x<sub>u<</sub>x<sub>u,max</sub>

<i>Over-reinforced section</i>
  
In the over reinforced beam, the tension steel percentage is more than limiting percentage due to which NA falls below the balanced NA and x<sub>u</sub>>x<sub>u,max</sub>. Because of higher percentage of tension steel, yield does not take place in steel and failure occurs when the strain in extreme fibres in concrete reaches its ultimate value.  

<strong>Flexural behaviour of under reinforced beam </strong>
  
During an experiment, to determine the moment curvature relationship, the factors of safety as mentioned during design (FOS steel 1.15 and FOS concrete 1.5) should not be used.

<strong>Apparatus and specimens</strong>
A combination of tensile, compressive and shear stresses usually determines the strength of the concrete beam when it is subjected to flexure or bending loads. In this test, to study the flexural behavior of the concrete beam, a four-point (also called the third point) loading setup as shown in the figure below is selected. The middle portion of the beam is subjected to pure flexure as shear stress in this region is zero.

<!-- A reinforced concrete beam is considered to have failed when the strain of concrete in extreme compression fibre reaches its ultimate value (εc=εcu), irrespective of whether the tension steel yielded or not. At this stage, the actual strainin steel εst ,can have the following values:

where f<sub>ck</sub> is the characteristic strength of concrete in MPa. This specified value is given after taking long term effects, i.e., creep etc, and other safety factors into account, for design purposes. To know the accurate value of elastic modulus of a concrete batch, laboratory test can be done.

The stress strain curve of concrete, when loaded in compression is not linear. This is because of internal micro cracking which occurs during the application of the load. A virgin specimen generally exhibits more marked curvilinearity. Because of this curvilinear nature of the curve, three times of moduli of elasticity can be defined:

<ul>1. Tangent modulus at a specified strain level</ul>
<ul>2. Initial tangent modulus</ul>
<ul>3. Secant modulus</ul>

It is difficult to determine, from static load test, the initial tangent modulus precisely. Other tests such as resonance vibration or ultrasonic pulse velocity test called dynamic tests can be used to determine it approximately. The secant modulus varies least with increasing stress/strain level and hence has been adopted by all codes of practice to define the static modulus of elasticity. Further, to ensure a degree of consistency, the effects of hysteresis (due to repeated loading and unloading) must be eliminated and the secant value determined at specified stress levels. A specimen which has been loaded and unloaded several times (up to a reasonable level of stress) will exhibit a nearly linear stress strain curve up to 30% to 40% of its ultimate strength.

For design purposes the static modulus of elasticity is considered equivalent to the chord modulus of deformation when the test specimen is loaded F<sub>c</sub>/9 MPa and F<sub>c</sub>/3 MPa where F<sub>c</sub> is average cylindrical compressive strength of concrete at 28 days age. The loading profile for determining the static modulus of elasticity of hardened concrete is shown in the figure below.
